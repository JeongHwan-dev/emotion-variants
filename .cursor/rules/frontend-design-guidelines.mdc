# Frontend Design Guidelines

## Role

- This bot serves as a coding assistant for frontend developers, supporting the creation of "easily modifiable frontend code" based on four core principles: readability, predictability, cohesion, and coupling.
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability to help create code that can flexibly adapt to changes.

## Principles and Checklists

### 1. Readability Principle

- Core principle: Minimize the context that readers need to consider at once, and ensure the code flows naturally from top to bottom.

#### 1-1. Reducing Context

- Core principle: Separate code that doesn't execute together into separate functions or components.
- Checklist:
  - Have you separated code that doesn't execute together into separate functions or components?
  - Have you separated complex branching logic into components by permission or state?

- Core principle: Abstract implementation details to clearly reveal core logic.
- Checklist:
  - Have you abstracted implementation details to clearly reveal core logic?

- Core principle: Functions and Hooks should each have a single, clear responsibility (single responsibility).
- Checklist:
  - Do functions and Hooks each perform only one clear responsibility?

#### 1-2. Clear Naming

- Core principle: Assign meaningful variable names to complex conditional expressions.
- Checklist:
  - Have you assigned meaningful variable names to complex conditional expressions?

- Core principle: Declare magic numbers as constants and use meaningful names for constants, functions, and components.
- Checklist:
  - Have you declared magic numbers as constants with meaningful names?
  - Do function names clearly express their behavior?
  - Do Hook names start with `use` and clearly indicate their purpose?
  - Do component names use PascalCase and clearly express their role?

#### 1-3. Making Code Easy to Read Top to Bottom

- Core principle: Minimize temporal shifts to make code flow clear.
- Checklist:
  - Is the code flow clear with minimal temporal shifts?

- Core principle: If ternary operators are complexly nested, expand them into if-else statements.
- Checklist:
  - Have you expanded complex ternary operators into if-else statements?

### 2. Predictability Principle

- Core principle: Follow consistent rules so that the behavior of functions or components can be understood just by looking at their names, parameters, and return values.

#### 2-1. Managing Names to Avoid Conflicts

- Core principle: Use clear names that distinguish from existing library functions.
- Checklist:
  - Have you used clear names that distinguish from existing library functions?
  - Are global variable names unique and meaningful?
  - Are you avoiding similar variable names within the same scope?
  - Have you used clear naming when wrapping library functions?

#### 2-2. Unifying Return Types for Similar Functions

- Core principle: Functions or Hooks of the same type maintain consistent return forms.
- Checklist:
  - Do functions or Hooks of the same type maintain consistent return forms?

#### 2-3. Revealing Hidden Logic

- Core principle: Do not include logic that cannot be predicted from the function's name, parameters, and return value.
- Checklist:
  - Have you explicitly handled hidden logic like logging or analytics at the call site?

### 3. Cohesion Principle

- Core principle: Place files that need to be modified together in the same directory.

#### 3-1. Placing Related Files in the Same Directory

- Core principle: Organize directories by domain to group related code together.
- Checklist:
  - Are you avoiding direct references to code from other domains?
  - Have you appropriately separated common components from domain-specific components?

#### 3-2. Eliminating Magic Numbers

- Core principle: Declare magic numbers as meaningful constants, and manage values that need to change together in the same file.
- Checklist:
  - Have you declared magic numbers as meaningful constants?
  - Are values that need to change together managed in the same file?
  - Do constant names clearly express their purpose?

#### 3-3. Considering Form Cohesion

- Core principle: If independent validation per field is needed, manage cohesion at the field level.
- Checklist:
  - Have you managed at the field level when independent validation per field is needed?

- Core principle: If the entire form represents a single function, manage cohesion at the form level.
- Checklist:
  - Have you managed at the form level when the entire form represents a single function?

### 4. Coupling Principle

- Core principle: Minimize the impact scope when modifying code and write code so that change results can be easily predicted.

#### 4-1. Managing Responsibilities One at a Time

- Core principle: Design functions and Hooks to each perform only one clear responsibility (single responsibility).
- Checklist:
  - Do functions and Hooks each perform only one clear responsibility?

#### 4-2. Allowing Duplicate Code

- Core principle: Do not generalize if different requirements may arise for each page in the future.
- Checklist:
  - Has the code not become more complex due to abstraction?

#### 4-3. Eliminating Props Drilling

- Core principle: Reduce unnecessary Props passing using the Composition pattern, and handle Props Drilling issues that cannot be solved by composition alone with Context API.
- Checklist:
  - Have you reduced unnecessary Props passing using the Composition pattern?
  - Are you not overusing Context API?
  - Are you fetching data directly only where needed?
